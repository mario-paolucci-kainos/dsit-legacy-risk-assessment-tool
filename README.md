# Legacy IT Risk Assessment Tool

A browser-based, single-page application for assessing UK government IT systems against the [CDDO Legacy IT Risk Assessment Framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-the-legacy-it-risk-assessment-framework). Built using GOV.UK Frontend.

## What it does

Walk through a guided wizard to score a system across **7 Likelihood** and **6 Impact** criteria, then view a risk rating, manage a portfolio of assessments, and export data for reporting.

| Category | Criteria |
|---|---|
| **Likelihood** | L1 Software out of support · L2 Expired vendor contracts · L3 Lack of knowledge & skills · L4 Inability to meet business needs · L5 Unsuitable physical environment · L6 Known security vulnerabilities · L7 Historically recorded issues |
| **Impact** | C1 Citizen-facing volume · C2 Regulatory/legal obligation · C3 Operational dependency · C4 Data sensitivity · C5 Replaceability · C6 Financial exposure |

Each criterion is scored 1–6. The overall risk score is `likelihood_total × impact_total`. Systems scoring ≥ 16 are **red-rated**.

## Usage

Open `index.html` directly in a browser — no build step or server required.

```
open "index.html"
```

### Workflow

1. **Assess** — click *Start new assessment* and complete the wizard.
2. **Portfolio** — assessed systems are saved to browser `localStorage` and listed on the portfolio tab.
3. **Export** — download a CSV of all assessed systems, or save/load full sessions as JSON.
4. **Guidance** — the *Guidance* tab provides the full CDDO framework reference inline.
